# Open Remote Start

A Particle project for interfacing with fortin remote starter and car alarm systems
via the antenna data-link interface.


## Why

This poject originated as a means to capture, analyze, and explore the data-link
protocol used by Fortin remote starters and alarm system. A unintended, but 'fun'
side effect of this work was a code base which could be used as a cellular remote
or wifi remote for the system.
